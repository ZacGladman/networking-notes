### What is a VPC?
- A VPC is a private cloud hosted on a public cloud.
- Unlike a private cloud, whose infrastructure is built and run by the entity that uses it, VPCs are hosted by a third-party public cloud provider.
- VPCs are kept secure from the rest of the public cloud through IP subnets, virtual local area networks (VLANs) and virtual private networks (VPNs).
- A VPC is like a reserved table in a busy restaurant (public cloud); only those with the reservation can use the table, and the restaurant sets aside some of its space for that table.
